## EPIC
An automated quarterly reporting system for EPIC funds, personalized to each investor. 

This program was created during an internship with EPIC funds. I also used Microsoft Power Apps to automate reporting to investors, but it was more costly and very slow. 
I used this project to show that there is a cost-effective, fast method to creating a report for hundreds of investors at once. 

`report.py` defines a functions to build visuals in python, uses byte string encoding, and saves a unique html file. `runreport.py` is a simpler python script to organize the data and call the function. 

The data is not shown here, as it is private. 

The most important folder is **`pythonautomation`**. Other folders were some scratch work with html and CSS.
